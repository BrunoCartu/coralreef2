# coralreef2
This is the coral agent-based model I created during my PhD at UBCO.

The full model, its analyses and description are published in [(Carturan et al., 2020a)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55993); the executable "complete_model.jar" file, the datasets and R scripts to reproduce the model analyses and simulations are on OSF [(Carturan et al., 2020b)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CTQ43). The latter link contains a Readme.pdf file with a complete set of instructions for installing and running coralreef2.

I used the model is investigate the functional diveristy *versus* resilience with coral species (798 species) [(Carturan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.780406).
